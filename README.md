# Termux-battery-controller
Cellphone battery charger controller with adjustable limits.

I am using Termux (linux-on-android) and Python2 and Wifi-controlled plug to limit maximum charging to 80% (and maybe limit heat rise too) because I have heard that this may lenghten to battery usability 5 times.
